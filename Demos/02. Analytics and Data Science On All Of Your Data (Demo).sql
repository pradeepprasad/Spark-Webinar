They make it easy for data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists to use whatever language they are most comfortable with. By simply entering the percentage sign along with the name of a language, you can turn any cell into a cell that runs code in your language of choice.\n\n<sp>\n- `%sql` - Query your data using SQL commands, or use DDL/DML to define and modify tables\n- `%python` - run Python code\n- `%scala` - run Scala code\n- `%r` - run R code\n  \n#### Other magic commands\n\n- `%md` - format cell contents as Markdown\n- `%fs` - access DBFS (the Databricks File System)\n- `%sh` - access the shell\n\n  \nThis notebook is a SQL notebook, so we can run commands in SQL without needing to specify the `%sql` magic command, but these commands come in handy when working in Python notebooks or other environments.","commandVersion":122,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1585689477473,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"cyrielle.simeone@databricks.com","latestUserId":"100006","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"ee5ba87b-89de-4fc0-b56e-6cf3826f81bb"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":17393049,"guid":"dd9c9160-9bd9-4aa5-a538-f5d289edf394","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":0.51025390625,"command":"%md

![Delta Lake Tiny Logo](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Connecting Delta Lake tables to BI tools for analytics, reporting, and dashboarding\n\nDelta Lake provides an excellent source of clean, reliable data that can easily be connected to many popular BI, reporting, and dashboarding tools through Databricks. Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html). In this demonstration, we'll connect to **Tableau**. Once your data is clean and conforming in a Delta Lake Silver table, follow the steps outlined below to create a [JDBC/ODBC connection](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/tableau.html#tableau) between your Delta Lake data in Databricks and Tableau Desktop.\n\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Tableau_Logo.png/320px-Tableau_Logo.png\" width=320/>\n\n### 1. Getting connection credentials from Databricks cluster\n\n- In Databricks, click **Clusters** in the left menu and select the cluster from the list. Get the **hostname** and **HTTP path** of your Databricks cluster on the Cluster details page, under **Advanced settings** => **JDBC/ODBC**.\n\n<img src=\"https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/JDBC%20connection%20GIF.gif\" width=800/>\n\n### 2.
