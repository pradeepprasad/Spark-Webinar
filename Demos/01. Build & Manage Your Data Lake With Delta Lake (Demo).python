schema, the next step is to create a Gold table. Gold tables are often created to provide clean, reliable data for a specific business unit or use case.\n\nIn our case, we'll create a Gold table that includes only 2 columns - `addr_state` and `count` - to provide an aggregated view of our data. For our purposes, this table will allow us to show what Delta Lake can do, but in practice a table like this could be used to feed a downstream reporting or BI tool that needs data formatted in a very specific way. Silver tables often feed multiple downstream Gold tables.","commandVersion":231,"state":"finished","results":null,"errorSummary":null,"error":null,"workflows":[],"startTime":0,"submitTime":1585689918739,"finishTime":0,"collapsed":false,"bindings":{},"inputWidgets":{},"displayType":"table","width":"auto","height":"auto","xColumns":null,"yColumns":null,"pivotColumns":null,"pivotAggregation":null,"useConsistentColors":false,"customPlotOptions":{},"commentThread":[],"commentsVisible":false,"parentHierarchy":[],"diffInserts":[],"diffDeletes":[],"globalVars":{},"latestUser":"brenner.heintz@databricks.com","latestUserId":"100006","commandTitle":"","showCommandTitle":false,"hideCommandCode":false,"hideCommandResult":false,"isLockedInExamMode":false,"iPythonMetadata":null,"streamStates":{},"datasetPreviewNameToCmdIdMap":{},"nuid":"90ea2d2e-60a9-401a-afa7-e743064caa43"},{"version":"CommandV1","origId":17392912,"guid":"014d6403-8214-4d9c-9c48-00e910853248","subtype":"command","commandType":"auto","position":3.8235732838511467,"command":"#
